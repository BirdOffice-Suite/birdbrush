# birdbrush
BirdBrush is a digital painting software designed with help from Google's Gemini tool.

It is part of the BirdOffice suite of minimalist but usable software for Windows and macOS.

BirdBrush was founded in August 2024 whenever I was looking for a tutorial to make a painting app in Python. Most of the resources I found had restrictive copyright licenses, which hindered my creative efforts.
To escape copyright, I turned to Google Gemini. 

With some guidance, the two of us managed to produce BirdBrush, which I now license under the Unlicense, such that other people can freely use and modify my software without the limits imposed by copyright law.
